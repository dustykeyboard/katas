## Basic String Compression

Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters. For example, the string aabcccccaaa would become a2blc5a3. If the "compressed" string would not become smaller than the orig- inal string, your method should return the original string.

```
node basic-string-compression.test.js
```

## Best Profit

An array contains share prices, calculate the best profit (buying before selling) for a single buy and sell during the set of data.

```
node best-profit.test.js
```

## Hannoi

In the classic problem of the Towers of Hanoi, you have 3 towers and N disks of different sizes
which can slide on to any tower. The puzzle starts with disks sorted in ascending order of size
from top to bottom (i.e., each disk sits on top of an even larger one). You have the following constraints:

1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2. A disk is slid off the top of one tower onto the next tower.
3. A disk can only be placed on top of a larger disk.

Write a program to move the disksfrom the first tower to the last using stacks.

```
node hannoi.test.js
```

## Two-stack Queue

Implement a Queue which implements a queue using two stacks.

```
node two-stack-queue.test.js
```

## Binary Search Tree

Implement a binary search tree with methods to insert, remove and walk the tree in order.

```
node binary-search-tree.test.js
```

## Heap

Create a Heap, implementing push and pop methods

```
node heap.test.js
```
